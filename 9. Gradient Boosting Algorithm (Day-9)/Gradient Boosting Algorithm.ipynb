    "Now we know that, boosting combines weak learner a.k.a. base learner to form a strong rule. An immediate question which should pop in your mind is, ‘How boosting identify weak rules?‘\n",
    "\n",
    "To find weak rule, we apply base learning (ML) algorithms with a different distribution. Each time base learning algorithm is applied, it generates a new weak prediction rule. This is an iterative process. After many iterations, the boosting algorithm combines these weak rules into a single strong prediction rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another question which might haunt you, ‘How do we choose different distribution for each round?’\n",
    "\n",
    "For choosing the right distribution, here are the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:  The base learner takes all the distributions and assign equal weight or attention to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: If there is any prediction error caused by first base learning algorithm, then we pay higher attention to observations having prediction error. Then, we apply the next base learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Iterate Step 2 till the limit of base learning algorithm is reached or higher accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it combines the outputs from weak learner and creates  a strong learner which eventually improves the prediction power of the model. Boosting pays higher focus on examples which are mis-classiﬁed or have higher errors by preceding weak rules."

The decision stump (D1) has generated vertical line at left side to classify the data points. We see that, this vertical line has incorrectly predicted three + (plus) as – (minus). In such case, we’ll assign higher weights to these three + (plus) and apply another decision stump.\n",

But again, it has caused mis-classification errors. This time with three -(minus). Again, we will assign higher weight to three – (minus) and apply another decision stump.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dd3.png\">\n",

    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) : It works on similar method as discussed above. It fits a sequence of weak learners on different weighted training data. It starts by predicting original data set and gives equal weight to each observation. If prediction is incorrect using the first learner, then it gives higher weight to observation which have been predicted incorrectly. Being an iterative process, it continues to add learner(s) until a limit is reached in the number of models or accuracy.\n",

    "Mostly, we use decision stamps with AdaBoost. But, we can use any machine learning algorithms as base learner if it accepts weight on training data set. We can use AdaBoost algorithms for both classification and regression problem.\n",
