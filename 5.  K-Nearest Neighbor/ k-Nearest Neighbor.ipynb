    "The KNN algorithm is a robust and versatile classifier that is often used as a benchmark for more complex classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Despite its simplicity, KNN can outperform more powerful classifiers and is used in a variety of applications such as economic forecasting, data compression and genetics. For example, KNN was leveraged in a 2006 study of functional genomics for the assignment of genes based on their expression profiles."

Informally, this means that we are given a labelled dataset consiting of training observations (x,y) and would like to capture the relationship between x and y. More formally, our goal is to learn a function h:X→Y so that given an unseen observation x, h(x) can confidently predict the corresponding output y.\n",

For example, suppose our data is highly non-Gaussian but the learning model we choose assumes a Gaussian form. In that case, our algorithm would make extremely poor predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Instance-based learning means that our algorithm doesn’t explicitly learn a model. Instead, it chooses to memorize the training instances which are subsequently used as “knowledge” for the prediction phase. Concretely, this means that only when a query to our database is made (i.e. when we ask it to predict a label given an input), will the algorithm use the training instances to spit out an answer."

Practically speaking, this is undesirable since we usually want fast responses."

    "At this point, you’re probably wondering how to pick the variable K and what its effects are on your classifier. Well, like most machine learning algorithms, the K in KNN is a hyperparameter that you, as a designer, must pick in order to get the best possible fit for the data set. Intuitively, you can think of K as controlling the shape of the decision boundary we talked about earlier.\n",

    "When K is small, we are restraining the region of a given prediction and forcing our classifier to be “more blind” to the overall distribution. A small value for K provides the most flexible fit, which will have low bias but high variance. Graphically, our decision boundary will be more jagged.\n",
